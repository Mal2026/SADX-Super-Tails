## Welcome to Super Tails v2.0!
This is a mod for the PC version of Sonic Adventure DX. It allows Miles to use his super form, this is similar to the [Super Sonic mod by Kell.](https://github.com/kellsnc/sadx-super-sonic)

In gameplay, Super Tails gains a golden energy shield around himself, he is invincible and can move and fly faster. While transformed, Miles also summons his "army of death", aka the four super-transformed Flickies that follow him around. Similar to Sonic 3 & Knuckles, The flickies will protect Miles by destroying all enemies around. If you lose your super form, the Flickies will fly away. 

The **default button transformation is Y**, so simply collect 50 rings, jump, press Y and enjoy the show. However, there is more that you should know and many stuff are configurable if you
take a look at the features below.
