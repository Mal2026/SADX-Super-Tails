# SADX Super Tails

Here we go: The first proper Super Tails mod. While being in Super form, Tails is invincible, can fly faster, has a better air acceleration and most important part: he has his funny army of death. 
That's right, the flickies are real and attack each enemy really fast to protect Miles. (Note: They don't attack bosses for now.) 

Note: You can change different settings as you pleasure: the number of the ring needed for transformation, the music during super form, the sound effects etc.
