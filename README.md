1. Welcome to Super Tails v2.0!
This is a mod for the PC version of Sonic Adventure DX. It allows Miles to use his super form, this is similar to the Super Sonic mod by Kell, except you play a fox and he has
his funny army of death, yes you read that right. 

The default button transformation is Y, so simply collect 50 rings, jump, press Y and enjoy the show. However, there is more that you should know and many stuff are configurable if you
take a look at the features below.
